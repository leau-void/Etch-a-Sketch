This is my Etch-a-Sketch project, completed as part of The Odin Project's Foundations.

It is optimised for mouse users and preferably for landscape mode screens, but can be used with any screen.

The project goal was to practice DOM manipulation, and as so I got to think a lot about how to achieve what I had in mind.

I feel more familiar with Event Listeners and with DOM manipulation, although I still have a lot to learn. I plan on revisiting this project later on, to see how I could make the Scripts better.

Refactoring the code a little bit, changed from multiple Event Listeners to an Event Delegation model, both for the grid cells, the buttons, and the range slider options.

Also changed these funtions for switch statements for readability.
